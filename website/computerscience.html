					<p><h1>Fundamentals of Computer Science</h1></p>
					<h2>Modules</h2>
					<ol>
						<a name="1" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Hardware and Communication</li>
						<p>This topic covers von Neumann architecture, networks and gives a basic understanding of the hardware required to run a computer, i.e. RAM, ROM, I/O devices e.t.c.</p>
						<a name="2" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Logical Operations</li>
						<p>Logical operations covers boolean algebra: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>AND</li>
							<li>OR</li>
							<li>XOR</li>
							<li>NOT</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These covers basic logical operations found within programming languages, for example, if the condition is statement 1 and statement 2 must be true to run a block of code, you will need to use the AND operator for the language.</p>
						<a name="3" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Data Transmission</li>
						<p>This covers the physical transfer of data along lines. It deals with three main forms of transmission: </p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Simplex - where data only travels in one direction, i.e. computer sending data to speakers.</p></li>
							<li><p>Half-duplex - where data can travel in both directions along the line, but only one way at any time, i.e. walkie-talkies.</p></li>
							<li><p>Full-duplex - where data can travel in both directions simultaneously, i.e. a video conferencing call.</p></li>
						</ul>
						<p>It also deals with routing data through a network, for example, the different ways of routing and how to deal with a data collision. You also need to be able to describe the seven main contents of a TCP/IP packet: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Preamble/Header</li>
							<li>Source Address</li>
							<li>Destination Address</li>
							<li>Sequence or Packet No.</li>
							<li>Type of Packet</li>
							<li>Data Payload</li>
							<li>Checksum</li>
						</ul>
						<a name="4" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Data Representation and Data Types</li>
						<p>Data is typically represented in binary, hexadecimal and denary form. This topic covers how a computer stores integers, both signed and unsigned using two's complement and floating point numbers, using a mantissa and exponent. It also covers the main data types: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Integer</li>
							<li>Character</li>
							<li>Boolean</li>
							<li>String</li>
							<li>Real</li>
						</ul>
						<a name="5" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Data Structures</li>
						<p>Data Structures covers three main topics: </p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Arrays - store multiple variables of the same data type using an indexed system. This allows you to store many variables without having to name each one and can allow for automatic assignment using loops.</p></li>
							<li><p>2-Dimensional Arrays - store multiple arrays of one data type within an indexed system. This allows the storing of multiple groups of information without having to individually name them and can be accessed using nested loops.</p></li>
							<li>Records - these store multiple variables of different data types within an indexed system, which is very useful for database style files, where telephone numbers and employee IDs are stored with names and addresses.</li>
						</ul>
						<a name="6" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Organisation of Data</li>
						<p>Data organisation is crucial to using any file. This topic aims to cover the different file access, i.e. direct, serial, sequential and indexed sequential. It also covers how files are updated, using master files and transaction files, data verification and validation and the need for archiving and backup.</p>
						<a name="7" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Database Systems</li>
						<p>This covers the basics of databases, such as flat file and relational database systems, where relational databases can link to other databases using foreign keys so each entry is only required to be input once and prevents data irregularities. It also covers entity relationship diagrams and the different normal forms, 1st NF, 2nd NF e.t.c.</p>
						<a name="8" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>The Operating System</li>
						<p>Operating systems are integral to computer systems, where they are required to manage resources, provide a user interface, manage the backing store and how data is processed, whether by batch, real time control or real time transaction.</p>
						<a name="9" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Algorithms and Programs</li>
						<p>This covers the design and logic behind building an algorithm, looking at top-down and bottom-up design practices, compression, identifiers, modular programming and parameters. This topic provides the basic understanding of the makeup of an algorithm, from designing it in pseudocode, to building it in a programming language.</p>
						<a name="10" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Principles of Programming</li>
						<p>There are many different types of programming language, for example, most games are written in high-level languages such as Java or Python, this website is built using mark-up languages, HTML, and this is all typically converted to assembly code and then to machine code (1s and 0s). This topic aims to introduce you to the different types of language and their uses and limitations.</p>
						<a name="11" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Systems Analysis</li>
						<p>Systems analysis covers the testing and documentation side of coding, checking the project is feasible, testing it works, designing it to suit the requirements and documenting it appropriately.</p>
						<a name="12" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Software Engineering</li>
						<p>This topic looks specifically at the role of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and the tools it provides for developing and debugging programs.</p>
						<a name="13" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Program Construction</li>
						<p>This covers compilers, interpreters and assemblers and discuesses the function of each, where compilers and interpreters convert the code into assembly code to be turned into machine code and run, whereas assemblers deal in assembly code, so just convert to machine code.</p>
						<a name="14" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>The Need for Different Types of Software Systems and Their Attributes</li>
						<p>The course discusses three main types of software: </p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Bespoke: This is where the software is designed specifically to meet the needs of the customer. As this is far more expensive than purchasing off-the-shelf software, it is typically only used for highly specialised applications, i.e. banking.</p></li>
							<li><p>Off-the-shelf: This means the software has been developed by a company for the mass market, it suits a purpose but is general enough a large number of users will have a need for it, i.e. Microsoft Office.</p></li>
							<li><p>Open Source: Open source software is typically free and delivered under a public licence, allowing anyone to access the source code and edit it for their own custom version. It also usually takes updates from the community, where users will send the entity behind the software bug fixes and features that the company can then add in.</p></li>
						</ul>
						<p>It also briefly discusses expert systems, such as WebMD, which take the knowledge of a group of experts and converts it to a database that can then be used tp provide a non-expert user with results quickly and cheaply. Howveer, there may be reduction in accuracy due to the lack of personalised information, especially for medical information.</p>
						<a name="15" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Practical Programming</li>
						<p>Practical Programming covers actually applying your knowledge to solving a given problem, such as a business solution for customer transactions e.t.c.</p>
						<a name="16" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Data Security and Integrity Processes</li>
						<p>This extends the work on data security from previous topics and looks specifically at the processes an individual or company can take to protect data from accidental and malicious damage, with specific reference to disaster planning and the laws surrounding data security, i.e. Computer Misuse Act 2000.</p>
						<a name="17" class="anchor"></a>
						<li>Economic, Moral, Legal, Ethical and Cultural Issues Relating to Computer Science</li>
						<p>This covers the impact computer science has on society, such as hacking, the laws that have been implemented to provide particularly internet users with privacy and protection and the ethical issues surrounding new technologies, i.e. artificial intelligence.</p>
