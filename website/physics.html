						<p><h1>Motion, Energy and Matter</h1></p>
						<h2>Modules</h2>
						<ol>
							<a name="1" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Basic Physics</li>
							<p>This acts as an introduction to GCSE conecpts, such as force, density and an introduction to S.I. units, vectors and moments. The moment about a force is the turning effect of a force, for exmaple, the force acting on a seesaw. It is calculated using the equation - Moment = Force * Perpendicular Distance.</p>
							<a name="2" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Kinematics</li>
							<p>Kinematics deals with rectilinear and projectile motion and the SUVAT equations for motion with constant acceleration. It also deals with the graphs for distance/time, speed/time and accleration/time, including derivations for the five SUVAT equations: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>v = u + at</li>
								<li>v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as</li>
								<li>s = &frac12;(v + u)t</li>
								<li>s = ut + &frac12;at<sup>2</sup></li>
								<li>s = vt - &frac12;at<sup>2</sup></li>
							</ul>
							<a name="3" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Dynamics</li>
							<p>Dynamics discusses Newton's laws of motion, forces, free-body diagrams (used to represent vectors) and momentum, including the concept of conservation of momentum. This is where the momentum at the start must be equal to the momentum after. This therefore covers ellastic and inellastic collisions.</p>
							<a name="4" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Energy Concepts</li>
							<p>This mainly recaps the GCSE work on energy, such as the types, the concept energy cannot be created or destroyed and the equations for kinetic energy (KE) and gravitational potential energy, &frac12;mv<sup>2</sup> and mgh respectively, where m = mass, v = velocity, h = height and g = gravity. For this course, gravity is taken to be 9.81ms<sup>-2</sup>.</p>
							<a name="5" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Solids Under Stress</li>
							<p>This topic covers the effect of force on brittle, ductile and elastic materials, Young's Modulus (E = &sigma;&frasl;&epsilon;), Hook's Law, that the force on an object is proportional to the extension produced, where k is the spring constant of the material. Finally, it looks at hysteresis and plastic deformation, where energy is produced, i.e. rubber band, and where the material is permanently deformed, respectively.</p>
							<a name="6" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Using Radiation to Investigate Stars</li>
							<p>This covers an introduction  to astrophysics, building on the work done at GCSE, covering absorption spectra, the electromagnetic spectrum and Wien's displacement law, Stefan's law and the inverse square law to investigate the properties of stars â€“ luminosity, size, temperature and distance</p>
							<a name="7" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Particles and Nuclear Structure</li>
							<p>The final chapter covers fundamental particles and their properties, covering baryons, leptons, quarks, pions and the conecpt of antiparticles, where each particle has an equally sized, but oppositely charged partner, i.e. electrons and positrons.</p>

							<li>Conduction of Electricity</li>
							<p>The conduction of electricity topic covers: </p>
							<ul class="show">
								<li>The unit of charge, the Coulomb(C), and its relation to the charge on an electron, e, as it is a fraction of a Coulomb(1.6*10<sup>-19</sup>C).</li>
								<li>An understanding of conductors and their ability to conduct electricity, including knowledge of insulators, semiconductors and superconductors.</li>
								<li>A definition of electric current as the rate of flow of charge, including a knowledge of electron current, conventional current and alternating and direct current.</li>
								<li>The application of the equation - I = &Delta;Q &frasl; &Delta;t</li>
								<li>The unit of current, the Amp&egrave;re, along with the knowledge of its value where - A = C s<sup>-1</sup>.</li>
								<li>A knowledge of the mechanism of conduction in metals - free electron drift.</li>
								<li>The equation for free electrons - I = nAve.</li>
							</ul>
							<a name="9" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Resistance</li>
							<p>This topic covers:</p>
							<ul class="show">
								<li>The definition of potential difference - the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge.</li>
								<li>An understanding of the unit of voltage - the volt(V), where V = J C<sup>-1</sup>.</li>
								<li>The current against voltage graphs for a filament lamp and a metal wire at constant temperature <!--- insert image here --></li>
								<li>Ohm's Law - that if the environmental properties remain constant then voltage will increase proportional to current, thus allowing the formation of the equation V = IR and the definition of resistance as - the opposition that a substance offers to the flow of electric current.</li>
								<li>The unit of resistance - the ohm(&#8486;), where - &#8486; = V A<sup>-1</sup>.</li>
								<li>The application of the equation P = IV = I<sup>2</sup>R = V<sup>2</sup> &frasl; R, where P is power, measure in Watts(W).</li>
								<li>Knowledge pertaining to the conditions that give rise to resistance, namely that collisions between free electrons and the ions in the conductor cause electrical resistance and that this is proportional to temperature.</li>
								<li>The application of the resistivity equation - R = &rho;l &frasl; A, where resistivity is the resisting power of a specified material to the flow of an electric current.</li>
								<li>The resistance of metals varies nearly linearly with temperature over a wide range.</li>
								<li>Collisions between free electrons and ions in metals ordinarily gives rise to an increase in the random vibration energy of the ions, thus increasing temperature.</li>
								<li>A knowledge of the meaning of superconductivity as the property of zero electrical resistance in some substances at very low absolute temperatures and the superconducting transition temperature, the temperature required for a material to exhibit superconductivity.</li>
								<li>Most metals have superconductive properties - typically with very low transition temperature - a few degrees above absolute zero (-273&deg;C).</li>
								<li>Certain material exhibit superconductivity at higher temperatures (high temperature superconductors) where their transition temperature is higher than the boiling point of nitrogen (-196&deg;C). This allows them to be cooled far easier than normal superconductors, so less energy and money is required.</li>
								<li>Superconductors are used in MRI scanners and particle accelerators.</li>
							</ul>
							<a name="10" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>D.C. Circuits</li>
							<p>D.C. Circuits, which were originally designed by Thomas Edison, is a topic that discusses:</p>
							<ul class="show">
								<li>The law of conservation of charge, such that the current at one end of a circuit is equal to the current at the other end, results in the current across series components being equal, while the sum of the currents in parallel sections is equal to that in the series part.</li>
								<li>The law of conservation of energy, such that the voltage at one end of a circuit is equal to the voltage at the other end, results in the voltage across parallel components to be equal, while the sum of the voltages across series components equals the potential difference across the source.</li>
								<li>Resistance in series and parallels have the equations - R<sub>T</sub> = R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub> + ... + R<sub>n</sub> and 1&frasl;R<sub>T</sub> = 1&frasl;R<sub>1</sub> + 1&frasl;R<sub>2</sub> + ... + 1&frasl;R<sub>n</sub> respectively.</li>
							</ul>
							<a name="11" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>The Nature of Waves</li>
							<p>This covers the different types of waves, longitudinal and transverse, polarisation, phase relationship, the frequency/wavelength relationship equation - c = f&lambda;. It also covers several of the characteristic wave properties, such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Displacement</li>
								<li>Amplitude</li>
								<li>Wavelength</li>
								<li>Frequency</li>
								<li>Period</li>
								<li>Velocity</li>
							</ul>
							<ul class="show"></ul>
							<a name="12" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Wave Properties</li>
							<p>Wave Properties aims to cover the interaction between waves and slits or obstacles, looking at Young's double slit experiment and diffraction gratings. This therefore includes developing an understanding of the equations &lambda; = a&delta;y&frasl;D and dsin&theta; = n&lambda;</p>
							<ul class="show"></ul>
							<a name="13" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Refraction of Light</li>
							<p>This looks at what refraction is, the refractive index, Snell's law - n<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub> and n<sub>1</sub>sin&theta;<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>2</sub>sin&theta;<sub>2</sub>. It also looks at the critical angle required for refraction to occur, n<sub>1</sub>sin&theta;<sub>c</sub> = n<sub>2</sub> and the uses of refraction, i.e. fibre optic cables.</p>
							<ul class="show"></ul>
							<a name="14" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Photons</li>
							<p>This discusses concept of the photoelectric effect, which demnstrated that light is made up of particles, photons. These particles of light are then effectively described by Einstein as E<sub>k max</sub> = hf - &epsilon; and later the equation describing the relationship between particles and their wavelengths - p = h&frasl;&lambda;</p>
							<ul class="show"></ul>
							<a name="15" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>Lasers</li>
							<p>This looks at how lasers are used, including pumping and its purpose, the uses of lasers, i.e. CDs and DVDs and the population inversion (N<sub>2</sub> > N<sub>1</sub>).</p>
							<ul class="show"></ul>
